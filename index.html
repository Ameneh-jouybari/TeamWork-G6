        <h2>What Is Teamwork?</h2>
        <p>
          It may seem like a simple question, but the answer often eludes many
          managers. At its most basic, teamwork is a sense of unity. It’s an
          enthusiasm that a group of people shares for their common interests
          and responsibilities. But delve deeper and you’ll soon see that
          teamwork is both a bonding agent and a lubrication of sorts. Teamwork
          brings people together (the bonding agent) and motivates them to rely
          on one another to get things done. Teamwork also makes progress easier
          (the lubrication) and allows the group to overcome obstacles that
          would have stymied an individual. Without teamwork, none of that would
          be possible.
